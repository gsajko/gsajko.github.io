      <description>Introduction This is an introductory post about the project I&amp;rsquo;m making. I&amp;rsquo;m in process of reading Machine Learning Bookcamp Book by Alexey Grigorev . The main &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; concept behind this book is the idea, that the best way to learn Machine Learning is by doing projects.
In parallel, I follow Applied ML course by Goku Mohandas .
I will try to incorporate things I learn from both of those sources while doing this project.</description>

      <description>Key to this method - follow lots of opinionated people. I follow many people - more than 600. There are many ML experts. So if I&amp;rsquo;m researching what methods to use, what algorithms, or just want to learn about a subject I&amp;rsquo;ll use Twitter first for that.
Using search Let&amp;rsquo;s say I want to learn how to do &amp;ldquo;topic modeling&amp;rdquo; on a dataset made of tweets. I just use search, remembering to check &amp;ldquo;People you follow&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>TLDR: use uBlock Origin block stuff with uBlock Origin uBlock Origin is a browser plugin, which I use mainly as an adblocker. But you can also use its &amp;ldquo;picker mode&amp;rdquo; to block custom elements from a website.
I used it for example to block out &amp;ldquo;Trends for you&amp;rdquo;
But it was not working correctly every time.
I tried this: https://schleiss.io/fixing-twitter-design-with-extension/ but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
So I found an even better solution:</description>
