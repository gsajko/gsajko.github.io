      <description>Collecting training data Collecting data I collect Twitter data using a library made by Simon Willison - twitter-to-sql .
My first approach was to do it by myself: Twitter API is very clear, so it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to just grab tweets with API and dump them into SQL? Right? It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem as a one-time-thing, as I usually had done in the past in jupyter notebooks. But if I would want to make something more robust - with proper testing etc it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a &amp;ldquo;custom twitter feed&amp;rdquo; project but a &amp;ldquo;Twitter API to SQL&amp;rdquo; project.</description>

      <description>Introduction This is an introductory post about the project I&amp;rsquo;m making. I&amp;rsquo;m in process of reading Machine Learning Bookcamp Book by Alexey Grigorev . The main &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; concept behind this book is the idea, that the best way to learn Machine Learning is by doing projects.
In parallel, I follow Applied ML course by Goku Mohandas .
I will try to incorporate things I learn from both of those sources while doing this project.</description>
